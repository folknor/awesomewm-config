# LegoStax's Dotfiles

Here's the files that enable AwesomeWM to work how I want on my machine.

Dependencies: AwesomeWM, Python, pygame, Pulseaudio

## Setup/Installation

- Install AwesomeWM 4.1
- Clone this repository into `~/.config/awesome/`
- Edit the `profileConfigPath` variable in `rc.lua` and `themes/default/theme.lua` to match the location of your `~/.config/awesome`

Right-click on the desktop and click Hotkeys to see a list of all of the keybinds.

The music player pulls songs from `~/Music/wmplaylist/`

Poke around for other things to tweak to your liking. Have fun!
